1.I have organized the project around 3 modules (Cashier, Balance and Transaction).
2.The REST apis follow hierarchichal structure.
3.In order to follow the changes of balances I have used the transaction, because they incorporate the all the info needed.
4.The json files contain all the urls needed to perform requests to cashiers balances and operations performing.
